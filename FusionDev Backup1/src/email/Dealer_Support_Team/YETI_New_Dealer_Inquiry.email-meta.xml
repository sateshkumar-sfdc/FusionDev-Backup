    <textOnly>We really appreciate your interest in YETI.  As I am sure you are aware we are experiencing incredible demand and at this time our product demand is so high we are currently unable to open new dealers. We are trying to make responsible decisions in our growth and support our current dealer base. We are hoping to be able to provide products to new dealers in the future and as soon as we are able to do so, our outside sales team will be going through all of the dealer applications which have come through our web site.

Thank you for being a YETI fan, and we look forward to talking with you in the future.
