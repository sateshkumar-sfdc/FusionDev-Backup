    <textOnly>The Rambler Slider Lid has been removed from the Spring 2016 program.



YETI has invested heavily in our product teams and establishing processes in order to ensure every product we release meets our high expectations.


During the final validation phase, our confidence that the lid&apos;s performance would exceed consumer expectations was too low. As such, rather than launching a product purely to increase sales, we have opted to remove it completely from the program. We may or may not address this design in the future.

Following this communication, the Rambler Slider Lid will be:

- Canceled from all orders

- Removed from the fixture program

- Removed from the website and customer-facing collateral


Feel free to reach out should you have any questions.
