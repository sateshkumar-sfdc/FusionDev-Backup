    <textOnly>Thank you for your email.

We are experiencing unprecedented demands that are outpacing manufacturing capabilities.  Due to these constraints we have paused the distribution of products into the Corporate, Premium and Promotional Products channel.

We do anticipate re-entering this marketplace in the future but not until we are able to provide our existing distribution partners the necessary product availability to be successful.

Best Regards.
