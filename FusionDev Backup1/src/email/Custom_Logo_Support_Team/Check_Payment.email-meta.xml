    <textOnly>Your customized order is ready for production!  Before we can begin customizing your order payment is required.  Below are the details for submitting check payment to us.

Please make checks payable to:

YETI Custom Shop

*Please reference your Sales Order number in the notes section of your check.*
*Payments sent to YETI Coolers will not post to your account and will delay your order.*

Please mail your check to:

We strongly suggest that you send your check OVERNIGHT with FedEx, UPS or USPS to avoid delays.

Please note: the customization clock will not begin until both payment has been received and your proof has been approved. Our current customization lead time is about 2-3 weeks from artwork approval and receipt of payment.

Once the check has been sent please reply to this email so that we can keep an eye out for it!
