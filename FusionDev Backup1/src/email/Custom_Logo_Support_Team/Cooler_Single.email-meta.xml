    <textOnly>We appreciate your interest in the YETI Custom Logo Program!

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to customize one or a few hard-sided coolers at a time due to high overhead costs. We recommend finding a local sign or print shop that can produce custom decals that stick well to our hard-sided coolers.

Also, the YETI Hopper has a spot where you can attach a hook and latch velcro patch if you were to get some custom patches made.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,
