<![CDATA[We appreciate your interest in the YETI Custom Logo Program!<br><br>Unfortunately, we are currently unable to customize one or a few hard-sided coolers at a time due to high overhead costs. We recommend finding a local sign or print shop that can produce custom decals that stick well to our hard-sided coolers.<br><br>Also, the YETI Hopper has a spot where you can attach a hook and latch velcro patch if you were to get some custom patches made. <br><br>Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>{!User.CommunityNickname} <br>Business Development Team <br>YETI <br>512.402.5895 <br>corporatesales@yeti.com<br>yeti.com <br><br>]]></td>
