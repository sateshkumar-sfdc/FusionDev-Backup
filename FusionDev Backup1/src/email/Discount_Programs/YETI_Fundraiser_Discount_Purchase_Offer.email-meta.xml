    <textOnly>Hello,

We sincerely appreciate you considering YETI for your event.  While we are not in a position to offer a full product donation at this time, we believe you may be a good candidate for our Fundraiser Program.  This will allow your organization to purchase up to two (2) YETI Hoppers (Hopper 20 and 30 models only) at a 30% discounted rate per event to be used in an auction, raffle, or as a tournament prize.  YETI reserves the right to approve or decline applications at our discretion.

If you would like to include any tax exemption on your order you will need to reply with your state&apos;s (not federal) tax exemption certificate.

When you are ready to order please contact us by phone at 512.394.9384 extension 771 or 561.
