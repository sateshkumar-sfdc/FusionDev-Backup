    <textOnly>Hello,


We appreciate you considering YETI for your event.


While we are not in a position to offer a full product donation at this time, we believe you may be a good candidate for our Fundraiser Program. This will allow your organization to purchase up to two (2)  YETI Hoppers at a discount to be used in an auction, raffle, or as a tournament prize. YETI reserves the right to approve or decline applications at our discretion.


In order to qualify for the Fundraiser Program, please provide some additional information on your event/organization (flyer, social/web link, or other official document). Additionally, please explain how the coolers will be used.


Please let us know if you have questions.


Sincerely,

{!User.CommunityNickname}
