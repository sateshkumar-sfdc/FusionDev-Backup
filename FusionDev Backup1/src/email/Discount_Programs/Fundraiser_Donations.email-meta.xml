    <textOnly>Hello,

This email is confirmation that we have received and will consider your request. Currently, our Fundraiser/Donation Program is suspended, and we are unable to offer funds, discounted or donated product. We hope to have this program back up and running at some point in mid-2017.

We appreciate your inquiry and thinking of YETI.


Sincerely,

{!User.CommunityNickname}
