    <textOnly>Hello,

We sincerely appreciate you considering YETI for your event.  While we are not in a position to offer a full product donation at this time, we believe you may be a good candidate for our Fundraiser Program.  This will allow your organization to purchase up to two (2) YETI Hoppers (Hopper 20 or 30) at a discounted rate per event to be used in an auction, raffle, or as a tournament prize.  YETI reserves the right to approve or decline applications at our discretion.


In order to qualify for the Fundraiser Program, please provide me with additional information such as an event flyer, website, or other official document explaining your event and how the coolers will be used.
