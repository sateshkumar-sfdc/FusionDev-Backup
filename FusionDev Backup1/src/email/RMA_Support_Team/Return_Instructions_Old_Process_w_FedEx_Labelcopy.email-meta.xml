    <textOnly>Your Return Request Confirmation

Hello,


Thank you for sending over your warranty request information. We have authorized your warranty exchange and will be replacing your defective product. We know how disappointing it can be to receive items and have them not work out for you, so we are going to do our best to make this process quick and easy.  This email highlights and explains the return process in order to give you a better understanding of how we do things!


Please verify the return product information below matches what you will be returning. If you need to make any changes, need to expedite your return process, need assistance with return product packaging, or have any further questions, please give us a call at 512.394.9384 so we can further assist.



Your Return Information:

Items returned:   **


To return your YETI product please follow the steps below:

A separate email will be sent to you with a return packing slip. Print off the packing slip and include it with your package. Confirm your address on the form is correct as this is where your replacement product will be shipped.
You will receive a separate email from us that contains the Prepaid FedEx Label to send your product back. Please print this label out and use clear tape to attach the label to the outside of the shipping box.

** Please ask for a copy of your receipt confirming your drop off at FedEx and keep this for your records. We recommend avoiding FedEx Drop boxes as they have size limitations and will not provide a confirmation of receipt. **

Please make sure your YETI product is cleaned out and dry on the inside.  When possible, we kindly ask that you protect your product during shipping by boxing your product.

We will do our best to ship your replacement YETI within 10 business days of receiving your product. During peak season times, it may take up to 15 business days. If your return product is not received within 30 days then your warranty case will be closed. Let us know in advance if you foresee any delay.

Thanks for being a YETI customer! Please let us know if you have any questions.


Sincerely,
