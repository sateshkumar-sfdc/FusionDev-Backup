    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear about the recent issue with your YETI Tank. To begin your warranty request we do require a few images to confirm and verify the size, color and issue you are experiencing.

•    Picture of the Tank looking directly at the YETI Badge in the front.

•    Picture of the side of the Tank to determine the size.

If you have any additional images of the issue you are experiencing please provide those as well. Please reply back to this email with these images.  Once we have received these pictures we will be able to identify the issues you are having and further assist you.


Sincerely,
