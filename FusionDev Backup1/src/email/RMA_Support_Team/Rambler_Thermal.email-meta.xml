    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear that you have experienced a thermal retention issue with your Rambler. To better identify any defect in the vacuum insulation we first require a preliminary ice test. This simple test consists of cleaning and drying your Rambler, filling it full of ice (no liquids / only ice), covering it with the accompanied Rambler Lid and allowing it to sit until the ice has completely melted.

Please provide the following information from this test.

•    Picture of the Rambler with the YETI embossed logo facing forward.

•    Picture of the Rambler full of ice and time of initial start of the test. (ex. 9:00 am)

• Picture of the outside of the Rambler once the ice has melted including the conclusion time which does not have to be exact (ex. 9:00 pm).

Please reply back to this email with these images. Once your warranty request has been reviewed and confirmed a YETI Outfitter will contact you with the next steps.

Sincerely,
