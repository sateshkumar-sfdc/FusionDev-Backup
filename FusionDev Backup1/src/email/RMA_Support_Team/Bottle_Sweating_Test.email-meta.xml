    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear that you have experienced a thermal retention issue with your YETI Rambler. To better identify any defect in the vacuum insulation we first require a preliminary ice test. This simple test consists of cleaning and drying your Rambler, filling it full of ice (no liquids / only ice), covering it with the accompanied Rambler Cap and allowing it to sit until the ice has completely melted.

Please provide the following information from this test.

•    Picture of the entire Rambler with the YETI embossed logo facing forward.

•    Picture of the Rambler full of ice and time of initial start of the test. (ex. 9:00am)

•    Remove the lid every few hours to view the melting phase. When the ice has fully melted please provide a picture of the outside of the Rambler, including the conclusion time which does not have to be exact (ex. 9:00pm).

Please reply back to this email with these images. Once we have received these pictures, we will be able to identify the issues you are having and further assist you.

Sincerely,
