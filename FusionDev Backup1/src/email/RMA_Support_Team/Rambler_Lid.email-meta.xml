    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear about the recent issue with your YETI Rambler. To begin your warranty request we do require a few images to confirm and verify the size and issue you are experiencing.

•    Picture of the Rambler with the YETI embossed logo facing forward.

•    Picture of the lid with the gasket available to view in the image.

Please reply back to this email with these images. Once your warranty request has been reviewed and confirmed a YETI Outfitter will contact you with the next steps.

Sincerely,
