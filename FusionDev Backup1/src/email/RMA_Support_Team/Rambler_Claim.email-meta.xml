    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear about the recent issue with your YETI Rambler. If you have a problem with your YETI and suspect that it may be due to defective materials or workmanship we want to get your warranty claim reviewed and addressed as soon as possible.

To get started you will need to submit your warranty claim here: https://yeti.formstack.com/forms/warranty_request_form

We understand sometimes it can be hard to capture in a photo what is going on however we will need to see the following pictures:

1. Please provide a full-length picture of your Rambler with the YETI embossed logo facing forward

2. An image of the Rambler base cap with Logo and manufacturing code

3. Any additional images of the issue you are experiencing such as the lid gasket, or sweating on the body of the Rambler

It is important that you provide full and complete information, failing to do so can result in additional delays in processing your claim.  Once your claim form is submitted we will review and get back with you as soon as possible usually within 1-3 business days.

We want to ensure we address any issues you are having so please reply to this email or phone at 512.394.9384 if you have further questions or problems. We look forward to taking care of you and will be in touch shortly after your claim is submitted. Our Outfitter team is here to assist Monday to Friday between 8:00 am – 5:30 pm Central Time.
