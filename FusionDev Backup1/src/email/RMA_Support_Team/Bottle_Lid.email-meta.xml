    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear about the recent issue with your Rambler. To begin your warranty request we do require a few images to confirm and verify the size and issue you are experiencing.

•    Picture of the Rambler with the YETI embossed logo facing forward.


•    Picture of the lid with the gasket available to view in the image.
