    <textOnly>Thank you for contacting YETI!

We are sorry to hear about the recent issue with your YETI Hopper. To begin your warranty request we do require a few images to confirm and verify the size, color and issue you are experiencing.

•    Picture of the side of your Hopper looking directly at the YETI Badge

•    Picture looking down at the zipper area or issue you are experiencing.

•    Picture of the tag on the end of your Hopper where the shoulder strap is located to verify the size.  Please make sure the image shows the size of the Hopper.

Please reply back to this email with these images.  Once we have received these pictures, we will be able to identify the issues you are having and further assist you.


Sincerely,
