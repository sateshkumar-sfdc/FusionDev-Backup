    <textOnly>Greetings,

The YETI Fundraising Program was established to serve nonprofit organizations and assist them with their fundraising events. We utilize either a Federal IRS document called a 501C3 which is a letter issued by the IRS designating the organization as a nonprofit. It is also acceptable to utilize a state tax exemption document provided from your state. All organizations must be a verifiable nonprofit to qualify for the YETI Fundraising Program. We would be happy to answer questions you may have; you can reach a member of the fundraising team at 512-394-934.

Sincerely,
