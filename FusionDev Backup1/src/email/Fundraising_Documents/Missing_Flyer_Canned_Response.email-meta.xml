    <textOnly>Greetings,

Thank you for reaching out to YETI. I have reviewed your documents and they look great. We are just missing the copy of your flyer advertising your event. You can reply to this email with a flyer, copy of a raffle ticket, or a screen shot of a website advertising your event.

I look forward to working with you!


Sincerely,
