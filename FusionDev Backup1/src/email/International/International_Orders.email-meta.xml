    <textOnly>Hello,

YETI ships internationally to select countries though our partnership with  Borderfree. To access the International country selector, or for a list of available shipping countries and shopping currencies, click on the upper right-hand corner of the website to select your flag and currency. Once a country is selected, product prices will appear in the local currency and order totals will be populated to include international shipping costs.
