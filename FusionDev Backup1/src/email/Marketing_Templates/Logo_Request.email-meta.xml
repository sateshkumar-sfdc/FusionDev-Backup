    <textOnly>We are so flattered that youâ€™d like to share our YETI Logo!

Our brand is very important to us, and we take immense pride in the way we show up.  As you can imagine, we receive multiple requests for this logo, and we would be unable to maintain brand integrity if we fulfilled all of these requests we receive.  We do not distribute our logo for personal use for this reason.

Thank you for thinking of us and for being a YETI Fan!


Sincerely,
