<![CDATA[Hello,<br><br>Thank you for reaching out to us regarding our MagSlider Lid.&nbsp; The MagSlider Lid is not leak-proof, but is splash resistant.&nbsp; Our Rambler tumbler is designed for a press fit lid interface and cannot be leak-proof.&nbsp; Our Rambler bottles, with their threaded interface, are our leak-proof solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>You may notice that our MagSlider Lid resists spills and splashes with cold drinks better than hot beverages.&nbsp; This has to do with water viscosity as cold liquids have a higher viscosity than hot liquids.&nbsp; Cold drinks do not move or flow as fast.<br><br>Please let us know if you have questions.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>{!User.CommunityNickname} <br>The YETI Outfitters <br>512.394.9384 <br>customerservice@yeti.com <br>yeti.com<br>]]></td>
