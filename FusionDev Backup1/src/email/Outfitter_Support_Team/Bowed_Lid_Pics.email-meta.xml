    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for contacting YETI!


I will be assisting you with your warranty request. At your earliest convenience please provide me with the following pictures of your YETI:

1. Picture taken directly with the lid closed in front of your Cooler looking at the YETI Badge.


2. Picture of either side of the YETI to identify the size.

Once we have received these pictures we will be able to identify the issues you are having and further assist you.


Thanks,
