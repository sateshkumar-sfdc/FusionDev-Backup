    <textOnly>Thank you so much for reaching out to YETI! We are just as excited as you are about the new prices on select Tundra and Hopper products.


Though we’re not able to issue a credit for the price change difference, I want to put another YETI product in your hand! I’m going to send you a stainless Rambler 64oz Bottle (retail value $49.99). The Rambler 64oz Bottle is a great accessory to a life in the wild, it will keep your drinks icy cold or perfectly hot, whatever the day calls for!


Can you confirm that this is the correct shipping address for me to send your Rambler 64oz Bottle?
