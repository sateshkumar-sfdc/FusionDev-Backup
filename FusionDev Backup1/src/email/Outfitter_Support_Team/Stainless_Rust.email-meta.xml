    <textOnly>Hello,


YETI stainless products are rust-resistant, however, rusting can happen on occasion. If youâ€™re experiencing rusting on your stainless product, we recommend using using vinegar and baking soda to scrub the spot and remove the stain. You can even use just vinegar, let it sit on the affected area for about 10 minutes then wipe out the stain.


You can also use Bar Keepers Friend Cleanser &amp; Polish to remove the rust/staining and maintain the life of your Rambler.

Also, don&apos;t forget that your Rambler is dishwasher safe! If you have access to the dishwasher, this can provide you with a deeper cleaning that is sure to get rid of any rust blemishes.

Should your cup still have staining, feel free to send a follow up note.

Sincerely,
