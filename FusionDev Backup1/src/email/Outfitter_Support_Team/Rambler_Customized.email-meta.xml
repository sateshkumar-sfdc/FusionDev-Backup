    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for contacting YETI!

I am sorry to hear about the issue with your Rambler. It does appear that the added coloring to your Rambler was done through a third party that is unaffiliated with YETI and our manufacturing process. Due to this, we are unable to offer a warranty replacement. The color options available on yeti.com are only the ones covered under our warranty.

In order to get your product exchanged, we recommend reaching out to the original seller as any Rambler products hydro-dipped or powder coated by a third party void the YETI warranty. We cannot guarantee the quality or the safety of the customized product.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

{!User.CommunityNickname}
