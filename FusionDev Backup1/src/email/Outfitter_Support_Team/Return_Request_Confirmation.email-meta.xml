To return your YETI product please follow the steps below:

**IMPORTANT** We want you to have your replacement as quickly as possible so you can keep on using your YETI product!  In exchange, we ask that you have your return cooler back in our hands in 7 business days from the day you receive the new product. If the return product has not been received by the end of the 7th day, the card on file will be charged.

**Note: The date on the Sales Order form attached, is not necessarily the date the product shipped out.

After your new product arrives, print off the attached RMA form and include it with your package. (Please place it inside the cooler or along with the items you are returning.)

If you need to find an authorized FedEx location in your area that will accept the return product, please visit the FedEx.com website and use their Find a Location Tool.  *Note that drop boxes cannot accept these packages. Additionally, a FedEx pick up can be arranged. Please let us know if you need our assistance in scheduling a FedEx pick up. Please ensure your property is secure in the instance of a pick up.


Please make sure your YETI is cleaned out and dry on the inside. We kindly ask that you protect your product during shipping by boxing your cooler.

Once your return has been received at YETI Coolers, you will receive an email confirmation from FedEx.

Please let us know if you have any questions throughout this process.
