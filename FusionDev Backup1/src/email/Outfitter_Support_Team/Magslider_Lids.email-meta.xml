    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding our MagSlider Lid.  The MagSlider Lid is not leak-proof, but is splash resistant.  Our Rambler tumbler is designed for a press fit lid interface and cannot be leak-proof.  Our Rambler bottles, with their threaded interface, are our leak-proof solution.

You may notice that our MagSlider Lid resists spills and splashes with cold drinks better than hot beverages.  This has to do with water viscosity as cold liquids have a higher viscosity than hot liquids.  Cold drinks do not move or flow as fast.

Please let us know if you have questions.

Sincerely,
