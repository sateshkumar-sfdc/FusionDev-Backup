    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for your recent YETI Order. We are aware that due to an error on our end you have been overcharged freight on your order. We apologize for any inconvenience that we may have caused you.

We are working diligently with our Credit Card processing company to resolve the freight overcharge from your recent order. We are hoping to have resolution to this by the end of today. Once the refund has been processed please allow 1-4 business days for the transaction to be reflected on your account. Due to the Holiday weekend, if you do not see this on your account by Friday, July 8th,please feel free to give us a call at 512.394.9384 and we will be glad to look further into this for you.
