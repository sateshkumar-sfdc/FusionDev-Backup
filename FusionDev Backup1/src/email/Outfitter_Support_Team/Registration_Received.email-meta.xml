    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for reaching out and congrats on your new YETI product.

So sorry about that error popping up! I checked out your account and it looks like the registration did go through. Your gift should be mailed to the address provided within 4-6 weeks.

If I can help with anything else, please do not hesitate to give us a shout.

Enjoy your YETI!
