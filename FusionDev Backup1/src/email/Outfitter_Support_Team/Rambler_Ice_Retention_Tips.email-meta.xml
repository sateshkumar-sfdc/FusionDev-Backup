    <textOnly>Hello,

There are many variables that go into how long ice will last in our Ramblers.  We appreciate you taking the time to ask about them!

When you fill your Rambler, it is important to use as much ice as possible - air is the enemy.  The more dead/air space you have in your Rambler, the more likely the ice is to melt.

It is also helpful to fill the tumbler with cool/cold liquid to begin with - this will help the ice retain the temperature in the tumbler.

Let us know if these tips help you out!


Sincerely,
