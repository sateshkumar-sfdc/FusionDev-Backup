    <textOnly>Hello,


As a premium outdoor brand, we strive to make the best products possible that meet and exceed customer expectations for durability, performance, and design. As part of this effort, we continually evaluate new and existing manufacturing partners. At this time, we cannot provide specific information regarding our manufacturing strategies.


Thank you again for your comments/concerns.


Sincerely,
