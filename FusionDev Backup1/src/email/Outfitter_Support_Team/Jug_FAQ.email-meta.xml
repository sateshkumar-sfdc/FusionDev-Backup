    <textOnly>Hello,

Your Jug Mount can be fastened to your work truck, ATV, boat, or trailer – it’s up to you!  As far as the mounting/drilling of the holes – that’s up to you as well.

You can find replacement hardware for your Jug Mount at your local hardware store.  To secure that mount down, you can find our Bear Proof Locks http://yeti.com/bear-resistant-lock.


Sincerely,
