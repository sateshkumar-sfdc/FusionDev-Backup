    <textOnly>Thank you for your email. We have launched a new yeti.com website to give you a better shopping experience. So we sent you an email to reset your password as this will need to be done to login to your previous account.  This way the next time you are getting ready for the wild, your account is ready to go.

Thanks for your help on this and we hope you enjoy the new yeti.com!

Sincerely,
