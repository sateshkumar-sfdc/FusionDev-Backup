    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for contacting YETI!

I am sorry to hear about the issue with your Rambler. It does appear that the added coloring to your Rambler was done through a third party that is unaffiliated with YETI and our manufacturing process. Due to this, we are unable to offer a warranty replacement. The color options available on yeti.com are only the ones covered under our warranty. However, I would be more than happy to offer you a 30% discount on the purchase of a new Rambler 30 from YETI.

In order to get your product exchanged, we recommend reaching out to the original seller as any Rambler products hydro-dipped or powder coated by a third party void the YETI warranty. We cannot guarantee the quality or the safety of the customized product.  If you would like to redeem your discount, please give us a call at 512-394-9384 between 8 am and 5:30 pm CST, Monday - Friday, and we would be more than happy to place that order over the phone for you.

Sincerely,
