    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for contacting YETI!

We’re sorry to hear that you’re having issues with your Rambler lid. Have you recently removed the gasket in order to thoroughly clean your lid? If so, we need to make sure the gasket was replaced properly. When looking at your gasket, you will notice two blades, one that sticks out further than the other. Please ensure the larger blade is above the smaller blade, as this will create a tight fit in order to prevent leaking from the gasket.


If your gasket appears to be on properly, please let us know so we can further troubleshoot your issue.

Sincerely,

{!User.CommunityNickname}
