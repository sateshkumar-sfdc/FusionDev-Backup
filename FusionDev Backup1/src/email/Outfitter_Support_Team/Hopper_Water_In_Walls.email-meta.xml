    <textOnly>Hello,

We design our Hoppers to withstand pressure changes, elevation changes, even getting run over by a Jeep.  With this design, air must be allowed to escape.

The water that youâ€™re seeing in the walls of your Hopper is a result of this venting and is completely normal.  Our suggestion is to turn that Hopper upside down and let the water drain out.

Sincerely,
