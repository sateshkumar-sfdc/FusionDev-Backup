    <textOnly>Thanks so much for reaching out!


The magnetic slider on your Rambler MagSlider Lid is intended to be removable. When the Rambler is met with excessive external force, it is possible for the slider to come off. Don&apos;t fret as this can be easily replaced using magnet technology! If you still have the piece, I recommend washing it off and pressing it back on your lid. The magnet will snap it right back into place, good as new. If you ever need to purchase replacements, please refer to our website https://www.yeti.com/accessories/replacement-magslider/21070100003.html


If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this email.

Happy adventures-
